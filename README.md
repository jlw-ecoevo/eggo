# EGGO

EGGO database and code for associated manuscript. See the [`gRodon`](https://github.com/jlw-ecoevo/gRodon) package for generating your own maximal growth rate predictions.

You can find the full database in `Data/EGGO.csv` or in an R binary file in `Data/EGGO.RData` (can be loaded into R more quickly using the `load()` function). 

Otherwise all code used to generate the graphics in `Figs/` can be found in `Scripts/`, with intermediate datasets and metadata in `Data/`.
